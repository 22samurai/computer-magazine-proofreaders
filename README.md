# computer-magazine-proofreaders
A project to extract and understand the proofreading algorithms from vintage computer magazines. 

Currently, we have python implementations of these proofreader programs:
- __Compute! Magazine__
  - Apple II Applesoft Basic ("Apple II Proofreader")
  - Apple II Machine Language / "Apple Monitor" / 6502 Assembly ("Apple MLX")
  - Commodore 64/128 Machine Language (v2) ("Commodore MLX")
